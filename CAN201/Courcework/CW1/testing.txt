Local-to-Virtual Machine File Transfer Testing
To evaluate the functionality and stability of the implemented file-transfer system, we conducted an end-to-end test using an Ubuntu 22.04 virtual machine as the server and the local host machine as the client. The client uploaded a 10 MB text file to the server under the default localhost communication setup. During the experiment, the server successfully received the complete file, verified its integrity using an MD5 checksum, and returned a confirmation response. The connection remained stable throughout the transfer, and no packet loss, timeouts, or retries were observed. These results demonstrate that the system is capable of reliably handling medium-sized data transfers in a local network environment, validating both the correctness of the protocol design and the robustness of the server implementation.

Upload Performance Evaluation
To evaluate the efficiency and stability of the implemented file-transfer protocol, a series of upload tests were conducted using files ranging from 1 MB to 20 MB. The results demonstrate both consistent throughput and reliable data integrity verification. As shown in the logged measurements, the system successfully handled all tested file sizes with stable upload speeds between 2.22 MB/s and 3.95 MB/s, and each transfer completed with a correct MD5 checksum match, indicating error-free transmission. Specifically, the upload times increased proportionally with file size: the 1 MB file completed in 451 ms, the 10 MB file in 2573 ms, and the largest 20 MB file in 5113 ms
Throughout all experiments, the connection workflows terminated cleanly after successful verification. These results confirm that the protocol maintains consistent performance and reliability across varying data loads, supporting its suitability for practical deployment.[figure3]

Cross-Format Upload Stability Test
To further assess the robustness of the upload subsystem, additional experiments were conducted using ten different file formats, each with a size of approximately 10 MB. The results demonstrate that the system maintains stable performance independent of file type. Across all formats—including TXT, MP3, MP4, DOCX, PPTX, JPG, PNG, and PDF—the measured upload times fell within a narrow range between 2473 ms and 2756 ms, corresponding to transmission rate from 3.63 MB/s to 4.04 MB/s [figure 4]

The system successfully verified the integrity of every transfer: all files produced matching MD5 checksums and completed without transmission errors or connection instability. Notably, even formats with differing compressibility and binary structures, such as MP3, PNG, and DOCX, exhibited nearly identical upload speeds, indicating that the protocol’s performance is primarily constrained by network throughput rather than file content. These results confirm the system’s format-agnostic stability and reliability under uniform file-size conditions.

Multithreaded Upload Performance Evaluation
To evaluate the scalability of the upload mechanism, we tested four threading configurations—single-thread, 4 threads, 8 threads, and 16 threads—across file sizes ranging from 1 MB to 20 MB. The results show that multithreading consistently reduces upload time compared to the single-thread baseline, with the most notable improvements observed at 4 and 8 threads. Performance gains begin to plateau beyond 8 threads, indicating that additional parallelism introduces overhead that offsets potential speedup. Overall, the experiments demonstrate that moderate multithreading provides the most efficient and stable performance across different file sizes.
